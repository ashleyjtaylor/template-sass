Apply these to any schema change, migration, or new entity.

## Prefixed entity IDs

Every system-generated identifier — entities (`User`, `Session`, future `Organisation`, `Subscription`, `Upload`, etc.) and ephemeral identifiers (`req_…` HTTP request IDs) — uses Stripe-style `prefix_<id>` form.

**Truncated, not full word.** 3-4 char prefix:

- `usr_` not `user_`
- `acct_` not `account_`
- `sess_` not `session_`
- `org_` (already short — keep)
- `memb_` not `membership_`
- `sub_` not `subscription_`
- `upl_` not `upload_`

**Generator**: `crypto.randomUUID()` (Node native, no dep). Same generator for everything; the prefix is the only differentiator. When `packages/ids` lands, it owns the generator.

**Storage column**: `entityId` (camelCase, separate from the auth-framework-managed `id` column on better-auth tables; primary key on tables we own). The `entityId` is `@unique` and indexed — it is the public-facing identifier in URLs, logs, API responses. Internal joins still go through whichever column is the primary key.

**New prefixes need user sign-off.** Once a prefix is chosen, it cannot be renamed without a data migration (the value is in URLs, logs, customer support records). Add the new entry to the registry below in the same PR that introduces it.

### Prefix registry

| Prefix | Entity | Defined in |
|---|---|---|
| `req_` | HTTP request ID | `apps/api/src/middleware/request-id.ts` |
| `usr_` | User | `apps/api/src/lib/auth.ts` (better-auth `additionalFields.entityId.defaultValue`) |
| `sess_` | Session | `apps/api/src/lib/auth.ts` |
| `acct_` | Auth account (better-auth) | `apps/api/src/lib/auth.ts` |
| `veri_` | Email verification token | `apps/api/src/lib/auth.ts` |
| `sub_` | Subscription (Stripe mirror) | `apps/api/src/modules/webhooks/stripe.ts` |
| `rl_` | RateLimit row | `packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma` (DB-side default) |

## Column naming

Default to **snake_case** for column names via Prisma's `@map`. Two exceptions exist today:

1. **Better-auth tables** (User, Session, Account, Verification) keep camelCase columns to match better-auth's vendor schema 1:1 — its docs and migrations assume camelCase, and remapping every field would create an ongoing maintenance tax. Our additions on those tables (`entityId`, `firstname`, `lastname`) follow the same vendor convention for consistency within the table.
2. **Tables we own** use snake_case (`created_at`, `user_id`, etc.).

If a future vendor library forces another camelCase island, document the deviation in the schema file with a comment naming the vendor and reason.

## Migrations

- One commit per schema change; one Prisma migration directory per change. Don't bundle unrelated schema changes.
- Migration names use kebab-slug describing the change (`add_auth_tables`, `add_organisation_membership`, not `update_schema`).
- Generated locally via `pnpm exec prisma migrate dev --name <slug>` (apply to dev DB). Apply to test DB via `DB_NAME=template_test pnpm exec prisma migrate deploy`. Same files run in CI's `migrate-db` ECS one-off task against staging.
- **Inspect the generated SQL before committing.** Prisma occasionally emits no-op or surprising SQL (e.g. converting `SERIAL` to explicit sequence + nextval) that may collide with the existing DB state. Strip noise; keep what actually expresses the schema delta.
- Once a migration is committed and shipped, **never edit it**. Add a new migration to fix.

## Partial unique indexes

Prisma's schema language can't express partial uniqueness (`UNIQUE ... WHERE ...`). When you need one — e.g. "at most one outstanding invitation per (organisation, email), but accepted/revoked rows don't collide" — generate the migration via `prisma migrate dev` first, then **append** the partial-index SQL to the migration file by hand:

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "invitation_organisation_id_email_pending_key"
  ON "invitation" ("organisation_id", "email")
  WHERE "accepted_at" IS NULL AND "revoked_at" IS NULL;
```

Apply it to the local DB out-of-band (`docker exec -i template-postgres psql -U postgres -d template_dev <<<...`) so dev / file / staging stay in sync. Add a comment in `schema.prisma` near the model noting the partial index lives in the migration. Service code should still pre-check for friendlier 409s — the partial index is the safety net under concurrent writes.

## Foreign keys + cascades

- Foreign keys to a parent that owns the child use `onDelete: Cascade` (`Session.userId → User.id`, `Account.userId → User.id`).
- Foreign keys to a parent that doesn't own the child use the default `Restrict` — let the DB block deletion until the caller explicitly handles it. No `onDelete: SetNull` unless there's a documented reason in the schema.
- Index every foreign key column. Prisma adds an index automatically when you declare the relation; verify the migration created it.

## Row → request correlation

Every writable table we own carries:

```prisma
requestId String?
@@index([requestId])
```

The column captures the `req_<uuid>` of the HTTP request that created the row. Inside any request handler the value comes from the `AsyncLocalStorage` context seeded by `apps/api/src/middleware/request-id.ts` — read via `getRequestId()` from `@/lib/logger.js`.

**Nullable + non-unique + indexed.** Out-of-request inserts (seed scripts, future BullMQ jobs, manual SQL) leave it `NULL`; one HTTP request typically writes multiple rows so uniqueness would be wrong; lookups are sparse enough that the index pays off.

**Set on `create` only.** Never overwrite on subsequent updates — the original creation request is the audit value.

**For better-auth-managed tables** (User, Session, Account, Verification): wire via `additionalFields.requestId.defaultValue: () => getRequestId() ?? null`. Better-auth's Prisma adapter strips fields not declared via `additionalFields` — see the `auth` skill for the full pattern.

**For our own future tables**: declare the column on the model and populate at the call site (or via a Prisma client extension once we have several). When we have a third call site, factor into `packages/db`.

**For full request meta-data** (headers, body hash, ipAddress, userAgent, etc.) on security-sensitive mutations: that lives in the `audit_log` table, not on every row. `requestId` here is the lightweight per-row correlation key; `audit_log` (next section) is the heavyweight semantic event store.

## Audit log

Deferred. When cross-cutting governance events (signup, plan change, account delete, etc.) need durable, compliance-grade records, add an `audit_log` table with append-only discipline (only `prisma.auditLog.create` from a single `writeAudit` helper; no updates/deletes except an anonymisation path on user delete). Stripe-style action naming (`<resource>.<event>`, snake_case verbs, past-tense). Best-effort writes, awaited but error-swallowed, outside transactions.

## Soft delete

Not implemented yet. When the first delete-user feature lands, add `deletedAt DateTime?` to the relevant tables and route reads through a repository helper that filters `deletedAt: null` by default. Until then: `delete()` is a hard delete.

## Readiness probe

`/health/ready` calls `prisma.user.findFirst()` to prove (a) DB reachable and (b) migrations applied. When the User table goes away or gets an access constraint that breaks a `findFirst()` from the API role, swap the probe to another long-lived table — but always use a real domain table (not a lighthouse table — those rot the moment a real model exists).

## Connection URL composition

Two places compose the Postgres URL from the five `DB_*` env vars: `apps/api/src/env.ts` (runtime client) and `apps/api/prisma.config.ts` (Prisma CLI). Both must produce the same string. The duplication is intentional — `prisma.config.ts` ships to the container's `/prod` directory after `pnpm deploy --prod`, where importing from `src/` isn't possible. Cross-file invariant comments in both files name the other; keep them in sync.

RDS endpoints (`*.rds.amazonaws.com`) get `?sslmode=require&uselibpqcompat=true` appended — RDS forces TLS, and `pg-connection-string` interprets `sslmode=require` as `verify-full` which fails against RDS's Amazon CA. Local Compose / CI Postgres doesn't speak SSL, so the suffix is gated on host name.

## Before adding a schema change, answer

- What entity prefix? Is it already in the registry?
- snake_case (we own it) or camelCase (vendor table)?
- Foreign keys + cascade rules?
- Indexes — beyond the auto-generated FK indexes, anything queried frequently?
- Migration name slug?
- Does this affect `/health/ready` or any other read?
